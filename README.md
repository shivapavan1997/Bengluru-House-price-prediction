# Real Estate Price Prediction Model with Data Science

## Introduction

Welcome to the Real Estate Price Prediction Model tutorial series! In this project, we will explore the process of building a machine learning model that predicts property prices based on various features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. To make the project more engaging, we will also create a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to perform home price predictions interactively.

Imagine yourself as a data scientist working for a prominent real estate company like Zillow in the US or Magicbricks in India. Your task is to develop a robust model that can accurately predict property prices, which is a crucial aspect for any real estate business.

## Project Architecture

The architecture of our project is as follows:

1. **Data Acquisition**: We will obtain a home price dataset from Kaggle, specifically for the city of Bangalore in India. This dataset will serve as the foundation for our model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We will perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Employing various data science techniques, we will extract meaningful information from the available features to enhance the predictive power of our model.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: To reduce the complexity of the dataset and improve model performance, we will use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

5. **Machine Learning Model**: Using Scikit-learn (SKlearn), we will build a machine learning model and train it on the preprocessed dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning**: We will evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and fine-tune it if necessary to achieve the best results.

7. **Model Serialization**: After training, we will export the trained model to a pickle file for later use.

8. **Python Flask Server**: We will develop a Python Flask server that exposes HTTP endpoints to handle price prediction requests.

9. **User Interface**: Creating a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we will allow users to interact with the Flask server and make home price predictions.

10. **Website Deployment**: Finally, we will deploy the website and Flask server on a suitable hosting platform to make it accessible to users.

## Tools and Technology

To accomplish our project objectives, we will be using the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: We will use Python as our primary programming language for its extensive libraries and ease of use in data science.

- **Pandas**: This library will assist us in data cleaning and manipulation tasks.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These data visualization libraries will help us gain insights from the dataset.

- **Scikit-learn (SKlearn)**: SKlearn will be instrumental in building our machine learning model.

- **Python Flask**: We will employ Flask, a micro web framework, to develop the back-end server that interacts with the machine learning model.

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: These front-end technologies will help us create a user-friendly website interface.

## Project Execution

The project execution will involve the following steps:

1. Acquire the home price dataset from Kaggle for the city of Bangalore.

2. Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies in the dataset.

3. Employ feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful information from the available features.

4. Utilize dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to reduce the dataset's complexity.

5. Build a machine learning model using SKlearn, training it on the preprocessed dataset.

6. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune it if necessary.

7. Export the trained model to a pickle file for later use.

8. Develop a Python Flask server that exposes HTTP endpoints to handle price prediction requests.

9. Create a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the Flask server.

10. Implement functionality on the website to make HTTP GET and POST calls for price predictions.

11. Deploy the website and Flask server on a suitable hosting platform to make it accessible to users.
